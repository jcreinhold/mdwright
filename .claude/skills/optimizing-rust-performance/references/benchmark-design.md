# Benchmark Design And Regression Tracking

Use the smallest benchmark that answers the question, then expand scope if the change can move cost elsewhere.

## Choose The Right Benchmark Shape

### Microbenchmark

Use when:

- you already know the suspected hot function or loop
- you are choosing between two local representations
- you need fast iteration before broader confirmation

Place it in the nearest crate bench file or add a new bench beside related ones.

### Scenario Benchmark

Use when:

- the hot path depends on realistic input shape or cache state
- the complaint is latency, single-file processing cost, or a specific pipeline stage

Look for an existing `single_file/*`, `interactive`, or `regression_*` bench near the suspected hot path.

### End-To-End Benchmark

Use when:

- the change crosses pass boundaries
- caching or invalidation changes
- a micro win might lose in total throughput

Look for an existing `full_build`, `per_stage`, or `collect_baseline_*` workload.

## Criterion Guidance

Use Criterion's comparison features instead of ad hoc timing loops.

```bash
cargo bench -p <crate> --bench <bench_name> -- --save-baseline before
cargo bench -p <crate> --bench <bench_name> -- --baseline before
cargo bench -p <crate> --bench <bench_name> -- --profile-time 10
```

Design rules:

- Benchmark the operation of interest, not just fixture construction.
- Put expensive, invariant setup outside `b.iter` when the workload under test is steady-state behavior.
- Keep setup inside `b.iter` only when setup cost is part of the real complaint.
- Use parameterized families, not one magic size.
- Use realistic input shapes, not only best-case atoms.
- Use `black_box` around inputs and results that the optimizer could otherwise erase.

## Allocation Benchmarks

Use heap profiling when allocation pressure is plausible. Common surfaces:

- a `collect_baseline_full` workload that tracks DHAT alongside timing
- a per-crate `dhat_profile` bench gated by a `dhat-heap` feature

Questions to answer:

- total allocations or bytes
- peak live heap
- whether fewer allocations increase retained memory
- whether allocation reduction actually improves wall time

## Interpreting Results

Be skeptical of small deltas.

- If a change is within noise, scale the workload or gather more samples.
- If a microbench improves but total throughput does not, the bottleneck moved or the microbench was too narrow.
- If time improves and memory worsens, report both.
- If memory improves and time worsens, report both.
- If only cold-cache behavior changes, say that clearly.

Do not over-claim:

- one run is not enough
- one size is not enough
- one machine-local profiler trace is not enough for a broad claim

## Common Bogus Conclusions

- "The new type is faster" when the benchmark mostly measured construction.
- "SmallVec helped" with no inline-size distribution.
- "FxHashMap helped" when the real win came from changing keys to integers.
- "This branch is cheaper" when the broader pipeline now recomputes more.
- "This microbench is green" when cached and uncached behavior differ and only one was measured.

## When To Add A New Bench Or Hook

Add measurement support when:

- you found a hot path with no stable reproducer
- an existing bench is too synthetic to catch the regression class
- reviewers would otherwise have to trust a performance claim on sight
- the repo has a profiling hook nearby but not at the granularity needed

Keep new support near the code it protects unless the workload is intentionally shared across the project.

## Review Checklist

For a performance-sensitive diff, ask:

- What exact workload was used?
- Is that workload representative?
- What were the before and after numbers?
- Did the author check a broader workload?
- Did they check both time and memory if the change could trade them off?
- Is there now a bench or profiling path that will catch future regressions?
